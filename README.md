My Point class is a but a simple one with only three private member float variables and
a few functions:

a default constructor
a constructor with input-defined variable initializations
a destructor
an accessor for each of the three member variables
a mutator for each of the three member variables
a functions that calculates the distance between two points
a function that calculates the area of a triangle defined by three points

The program asks the user for three 3-dimensional points, and, in turn,
calculates the area of a triangle whose vertices are those three points.
